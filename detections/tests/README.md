Reproducible regression tests that prove the rules under [`../`](../) actually fire — and, just as
important, stay silent on benign traffic. A detection rule you cannot run is a claim; these tests turn the
claims in the rule files and the defense guide into something a reviewer can re-run from source.

No binary packet capture is committed. The capture is **synthesized deterministically on every run** and
removed afterwards, so the test ships as readable source, not as an opaque fixture, and never bloats the
repository.

## Suricata — [`suricata/`](suricata/)

[`suricata/run.sh`](suricata/run.sh) exercises the network rules in
[`../suricata/artex.rules`](../suricata/artex.rules) end to end and asserts three properties:

- **Presence** — sid `1000001` fires exactly once per enrichment probe.
- **Velocity** — sid `1000002` fires once the `detection_filter` rate of 30 requests in 300 s per source is
  crossed.
- **Specificity** — an identical capture whose only change is a benign browser User-Agent produces **zero**
  ARTEX alerts.

[`suricata/gen_pcap.py`](suricata/gen_pcap.py) builds the capture with [scapy](https://scapy.net): N
independent plaintext HTTP request/response flows from one fixed source, each carrying a chosen
User-Agent, at a fixed base timestamp spaced one second apart. It only writes a file — it never sends a
packet or touches a network.

### Run it

Needs only Docker; scapy and Suricata both run in containers.

```sh
detections/tests/suricata/run.sh
```

Expected output (abridged):

```
  PASS  sid 1000001 presence: one alert per probe  (got 35, want eq 35)
  PASS  sid 1000002 velocity: fires past 30-in-300s  (got 5, want ge 1)
  PASS  benign browser UA produces no ARTEX alerts  (got 0, want eq 0)
RESULT: PASS
```

The script exits non-zero if any assertion fails, so it drops straight into CI or a pre-commit hook.
Override the images with `SURICATA_IMAGE` / `PYTHON_IMAGE` if you mirror them internally.

### Why the velocity count is a floor, not an exact match

`run.sh` asserts the presence count (`1000001 == 35`) and the benign count (`== 0`) exactly, because those
are engine-version-independent: one alert per matching request, and no match on a different User-Agent. The
velocity rule's count depends on how a given Suricata release resolves the `detection_filter` threshold at
the boundary, so the test asserts `>= 1` and records the reference value separately. On **Suricata 8.0.7**
the reference run produces **5** alerts on sid `1000002` (flows 31–35, after the 30-in-300 s threshold is
crossed).

## Sigma — [`sigma/`](sigma/)

[`sigma/run.sh`](sigma/run.sh) validates the Sigma rules under [`../sigma/`](../sigma/) structurally and by
compilation with [sigma-cli](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli) (pySigma), and asserts five properties:

- **Valid** — `sigma check` reports 0 errors, 0 condition errors, and 0 issues over the whole tree.
- **Compiles** — `sigma convert -t splunk` turns the whole tree into a backend query language without error.
- **Indicators survive** — each atomic indicator string (`artex-enrich/1.0`, `artex-selfupdate`, and the guard
  marker) is still present in the compiled query, so a rule cannot silently lose the string it is built on.
- **Correlations compile** — the behaviour rules in [`../sigma/correlation/`](../sigma/correlation/) emit their
  `event_count` / `value_count` aggregations rather than being dropped.
- **Correlations are load-bearing** — converting one correlation rule *alone* fails, because it references its
  atomic base rule by `id`; the reference is enforced, not decorative. This is the Sigma analogue of the
  Suricata specificity assertion above.

This is the structural + compilation validation documented in [`../README.md`](../README.md), made executable
and assertive. A live event-matching harness for the generic `webserver` / `proxy` / `application` log sources
is still intentionally not shipped: matching those authoritatively needs a backend that normalizes the fields,
and a weak matcher would undercut the rules rather than support them. Network rules are different — Suricata
reads a pcap offline and emits the alert record directly — which is why the reproducible *matching* test lives
on the Suricata side, while Sigma gets a reproducible *validation* test.

### Run it

Needs only Docker; sigma-cli and the splunk backend run in a container and nothing is written to the repo.

```sh
detections/tests/sigma/run.sh
```

Expected output (abridged):

```
  PASS  sigma check: 0 errors, 0 condition errors, 0 issues
  PASS  whole tree converts to splunk (exit 0)
  PASS  indicator present: artex-enrich/1.0
  PASS  correlation rule fails to convert alone — it requires its atomic base rule
RESULT: PASS
```

The script exits non-zero if any assertion fails, so it drops straight into CI or a pre-commit hook. sigma-cli
is pinned to a reference version (`3.1.0`); override it with `SIGMA_CLI_VERSION`, or the image with
`PYTHON_IMAGE`, if you mirror them internally.

## Contributing

A new detection rule is stronger with a test that shows it firing. Tests should synthesize their own input
deterministically, assert engine-version-independent properties exactly (and softer ones as floors with a
recorded reference), and avoid any content that reads as attack guidance. See
[`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the rule indexes in [`../README.md`](../README.md).
